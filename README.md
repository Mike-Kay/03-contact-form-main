## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

My major learning landmark regarding this project was basic web accessibility. I got exposed to another side of the web which uses the screen reader technology, and it was fun overcoming the challenges i encountered while trying to apply this technogy to building the project.

### Continued development

I think i have only scratched the surface for the minimum that was required to complete this challenge, i hope to learn more about web accessibilty.
